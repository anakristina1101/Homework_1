    <p>Hi I'm Ana, and I am a Chicago native but I have always had 
       a love of 'Small Town America' even though I am technically 
       a city girl. I lived in Culver, IN while attending boarding 
       school in high school, and Culver is as Small Town America 
       as America can get. I am married to my high school sweetheart,
       like a smalltown girl would be, typical right! We have 3 amazing 
       children, Logan who is 5, Zayn who is 3, and Autumn Rose who is 
       8 months.</p>

    <p> I work at a tech company that allows small buisnesses to do email 
       marketing. I'm on the Account Management team, but most of my friends 
       are on the Engineering team. They have convinced me there team is 
       "where its at" so I have decided to become a Software engineer as well.
       I love that Engineering will give me the opportunity for a career and 
       skills that I can take to nearly every industry</p>

    <p>When I'm not at work or in class with you fine folks. I love to be 
       with my family as well as go out with my girl friends. I love traveling
       as well. My most recent trip was with my immediate and extended family 
       to Puerto Rico for a week in June. We stayed a Mega Manison Air BNB like
        we were celebrities. It was amazing!</p>

    <p>I look forward to learning more in this class, more time with family and 
       friends, and planning the next big extended family getaway.</p>
